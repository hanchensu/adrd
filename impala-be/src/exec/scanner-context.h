// This class abstracts over getting buffers from the IoMgr. Each ScannerContext is 1:1 
// a HdfsScanner. ScannerContexts contain Streams, which are 1:1 with a ScanRange.
// Columnar formats have multiple streams per context object.
// This class handles stitching data split across IO buffers and providing
// some basic parsing utilities.
// This class it *not* thread safe. It is designed to have a single scanner thread
// reading from it.
//
// Each scanner context maps to a single hdfs split.  There are three threads that
// are interacting with the context.
//   1. IoMgr threads that read io buffers from the disk and enqueue them to the
//      stream's underlying ScanRange object. This is the producer.
//   2. Scanner thread that calls GetBytes (which can block), materializing tuples
//      from processing the bytes. This is the consumer.
//   3. The scan node/main thread which calls into the context to trigger cancellation
//      or other end of stream conditions.
