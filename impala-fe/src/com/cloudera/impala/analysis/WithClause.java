/**
 * Representation of the WITH clause that may appear before a query statement or insert
 * statement. A WITH clause contains a list of named views that may be referenced in
 * the query statement that follows it.
 *
 * Scoping rules:
 * A WITH-clause view is visible anywhere inside the query statement that it belongs to.
 * This includes subqueries and nested WITH clauses inside the query statement.
 *
 * A WITH-clause view definition may refer to views from the same
 * WITH-clause appearing to its left (and WITH-clause views from outer scopes).
 *
 * Each WITH clause establishes a new scope. Within this scope all WITH-clause views
 * from the current scope and all parents' scopes are visible.
 * References to WITH-clause views are resolved inside out, i.e., a matching is found
 * by first looking in the current scope, then the parents' scope, etc.
 *
 * Views defined within the same WITH-clause may not use the same alias.
